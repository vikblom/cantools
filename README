Issues
===================
* Cmake compilation is using an ugly hack to let everyone reach everything.
* Extended CAN msgs with dlc > 8 are not even read from blf file.
  Most likely they have ID BL_OBJ_TYPE_reserved_5=115
  which we have no way of parsing?

Notes
===================
* mdftomat compilation disabled since it
  includes sys/mman.h which does not exist on Windows.


General Information
===================

Tools around CAN logfiles, mostly Vector's BLF format.

Note: After fork only .blf is supported as input. For outputs .mat and .h5 are available.

* dbcls lists the contents of a DBC file.
* cantomat converts log files in BLF to MAT or HDF5.
* matdump displays the content of a MAT file as ASCII text
* dbccopy copies a DBC file


Compiling native Windows exe with MSYS2
====================
Use the "MSYS2 MINGW 64-bit" terminal
- Install compiler toolchain
```
pacman -Syu --needed make mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake}
```
- Install dependencies
```
pacman -Syu --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-{hdf5,matio,zlib}
```
- Build cantomat
```
cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" -B build .
make -C build
```

 Compiling in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
====================
Compilation in WSL is much similar, only installing dependencies are different:
```
sudo apt-get install gcc libz-dev libmatio-dev pkg-config flex bison check libglib2.0 subversion automake
```
