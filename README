Issues
===================
* Cmake compilation is using an ugly hack to let everyone reach everything.
* Linking against libmatio from msys2 repositories does not work.
  Executable fails with error msg:
  "The procedure entry point H5Rdereference coult not be
  located in the dynamic library
  C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libmatio-9.dll"
* Extended CAN msgs with dlc > 8 are not even read from blf file.
  Most likely they have ID BL_OBJ_TYPE_reserved_5=115
  which we have no way of parsing?

Notes
===================
* mdftomat compilation disabled since it
  includes sys/mman.h which does not exist on Windows.


General Information
===================

cantools is a set of libraries and command line tools for handling
ASC, BLF, CLG, VSB, MDF, and DBC files from Vector-Informatik and
others. The tools can be used to analyze and convert the data to other
formats:

* dbcls lists the contents of a DBC file.
* cantomat converts log files in ASC, BLF, CLG, VSB format to a MAT
* file (MATLAB format)
* mdftomat converts log files in MDF format to a MAT file (up to MDF
  version 3.x)
* matdump displays the content of a MAT file as ASCII text
* dbccopy copies a DBC file


Compiling native Windows exe with MSYS2
====================
Use the "MSYS2 MINGW 64-bit" terminal
- Install compiler toolchain
      pacman -Syu --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake}
- Install dependencies
      pacman -Syu --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-{matio,zlib}
- Build cantomat
      cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" -B build .
      make -C build

 Compiling in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
====================
sudo apt-get install gcc libz-dev libmatio-dev pkg-config flex bison check libglib2.0 subversion automake
git clone https://github.com/aheit/cantools cantools-code
cd cantools-code
./configure
make
